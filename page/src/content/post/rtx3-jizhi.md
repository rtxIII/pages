# Privacy Policy for Jizhi-rtx3
## Introduction
This privacy policy applies to the Jizhi browser extension, which provides a custom new tab page for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers, featuring noise waves animation in traditional Chinese colors paired with classic Chinese poems.

## Data Collection and Usage
### We Do Not Collect Any Personal Data
The Jizhi-rtx3 extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data. Our design philosophy respects user privacy, and therefore our extension does not:

- Collect any personally identifiable information
- Track user browsing history
- Collect user search queries
- Use cookies or similar technologies to track users
- Send any data to our servers or third-party servers

### Local Storage
The Jizhi-rtx3 extension only uses the browser's local storage functionality to save user preferences, such as:

- Animation effect selection (waves or blobs)
- Search engine preferences
- Theme settings (day/night mode)
- Font selection
- Interface layout preferences
- Custom shortcut links

This data is stored entirely on the user's device and is not transmitted to any external servers.

## Third-Party Services
The Jizhi-rtx3 extension uses the "Jinrishici API" to obtain poem content. When using this feature, your browser sends requests to this API, but no personal information is transmitted.

## Permissions Explanation
The Jizhi-rtx3 extension only requests browser permissions for:

- Accessing and modifying new tab pages: to display custom new tab content
- Storage: to save user preferences

## Data Security
Since we do not collect any user data, there is no risk of data breaches. All your settings and preferences are stored only on your local device.

## Children's Privacy
The Jizhi-rtx3 extension is suitable for users of all ages and does not collect any information about users' age or any data specifically from children.

## Policy Changes
If we make any changes to our privacy policy, we will notify users in the extension's update notes and post the updated privacy policy on our GitHub page.
